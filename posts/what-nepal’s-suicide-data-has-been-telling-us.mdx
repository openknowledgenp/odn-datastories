Suicide Is Not Just a Mental Health Issue, but it’s a mirror of society’s well-being, and the suicide numbers in Nepal paint a grim picture, which is often less talked about. Mental health, systemic neglect, and social stigma are converging in deadly ways. In the past year (2023-24) alone, 7,221 people died by suicide, a figure that demands urgent reckoning, not quiet resignation. Among the suicidal deaths, 56% were men, 33% were women, 8% were girls, and 4% were boys, clearly showing the age demographics within the suicide deaths. The disproportionate impact on men and the alarming numbers among women and children reveal the intersection of emotional isolation, economic pressure, and systemic failure to provide adequate mental health support.
