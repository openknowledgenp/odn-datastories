    # Understanding the Growth of Cybercrime in Nepal


    Nepal is experiencing an unprecedented digital transformation. As of 2025, the country has over **16.5 million internet users**, which is about **55.8% of the total population**. With **16.5 million social media users** and over **39 million mobile connections**, surpassing the population itself, the digital footprint of Nepalese citizens has expanded rapidly.

    However, this increasing connectivity has come with a darker underside: **a surge in cybercrime**.\

    In just four years, cybercrime complaints have soared from **2,301 in 2019–20** to a staggering **19,730 in 2023–24**. This represents a **757% increase**, and if the pattern holds, 2024–25 could surpass **25,000 reported cases**, making cybercrime the fastest-growing category of crime in Nepal.

    ## Who Are the Victims?


    While cybercrime affects a broad cross-section of society, some groups are more vulnerable than others:  


    * **Women**: 44.32% of all victims, often targeted through blackmail, harassment, revenge porn, and online impersonation.  

    * **Children**: 3.2% of victims are minors who face threats, abuse, or exploitation.  

    * **LGBTQI+ individuals**: 3.8% of cases involve targeted online hate or harassment.  


    These figures are not just statistics; they highlight how **social inequalities are being replicated and amplified online**, creating unsafe environments for marginalized communities.

    ## Provincial Disparities and Support Gaps


    Cybercrime reporting varies significantly across Nepal’s provinces, exposing disparities in digital literacy, infrastructure, and access to justice. The Cyber Bureau, which handles national-level complaints, including those submitted through Hello Sarkar, processed the highest number of cases by far, with 16,439 reports in the past fiscal year. Among the provinces, Karnali Province surprisingly reported the highest number of cybercrime complaints (333), followed by Bagmati Province (excluding cases handled by the Cyber Bureau) with 384, and Koshi Province with 1,149. Madhesh and Lumbini Provinces reported 683 and 500 cases, respectively, while Gandaki Province reported 182. Sudurpashchim Province reported the fewest, with just 60 cases. These figures may not directly reflect actual crime rates but rather highlight the uneven distribution of reporting mechanisms, public awareness, and trust in law enforcement. Low numbers in some provinces may stem from underreporting due to social stigma or lack of digital knowledge, while higher figures may suggest greater awareness and access to reporting systems.

    Facebook dominates Nepal’s cybercrime landscape, accounting for **over 81% of reported cases**. Its widespread use also makes it the most abused platform. Instagram, WhatsApp, and TikTok follow, while **Telegram is emerging as a rising concern**.  


    This trend underscores the urgent need for **platform accountability, localized guidelines, and faster moderation mechanisms**.

    ## Legal Framework and Capacity Challenges


    Nepal still relies on the **Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) of 2006** as its primary cybercrime law. However, it is outdated and does not address:  


    * Deepfakes  

    * Cryptocurrency scams  

    * AI-generated impersonation  


    Meanwhile, the **Cyber Bureau** remains **under-resourced**:  


    * **106 personnel in total**  

    * Only **28 trained IT professionals**  


    This shortage hampers the ability to investigate and respond effectively, especially as cybercrime spreads beyond Kathmandu into rural areas.

    ## Recommendations Moving Forward


    To counter the growing cyber threat, Nepal must:


    1. **Update legislation**: Draft a dedicated cybercrime law to replace the outdated ETA.  

    2. **Strengthen law enforcement**: Train more digital forensic experts across provinces.  

    3. **Expand digital literacy**: Integrate online safety and rights into school and college curricula.  

    4. **Support victims**: Provide psychological first aid, legal help, and safe reporting mechanisms.  

    5. **Improve accessibility**: Create a centralized, multilingual online complaint portal.

    ## Conclusion


    Cybercrime in Nepal is growing rapidly and visibly. As more people come online, risks grow too. But this also presents an **opportunity to educate, reform, and protect**.  


    By modernizing laws, expanding forensic capacity, boosting digital literacy, and supporting victims, Nepal can build not just a **more connected society** but also a **safer and more inclusive digital future**.
