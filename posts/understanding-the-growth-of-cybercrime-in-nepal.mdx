    However, this increasing connectivity has come with a darker underside: **a surge in cybercrime**.\

    In just four years, cybercrime complaints have soared from **2,301 in 2019–20** to a staggering **19,730 in 2023–24**. This represents a **757% increase**, and if the pattern holds, 2024–25 could surpass **25,000 reported cases**, making cybercrime the fastest-growing category of crime in Nepal.

    ## Who Are the Victims?


    While cybercrime affects a broad cross-section of society, some groups are more vulnerable than others:  


    * **Women**: 44.32% of all victims, often targeted through blackmail, harassment, revenge porn, and online impersonation.  

    * **Children**: 3.2% of victims are minors who face threats, abuse, or exploitation.  

    * **LGBTQI+ individuals**: 3.8% of cases involve targeted online hate or harassment.  


    These figures are not just statistics; they highlight how **social inequalities are being replicated and amplified online**, creating unsafe environments for marginalized communities.

    ## Provincial Disparities and Support Gaps


    Cybercrime reporting varies significantly across Nepal’s provinces, exposing disparities in digital literacy, infrastructure, and access to justice. The Cyber Bureau, which handles national-level complaints, including those submitted through Hello Sarkar, processed the highest number of cases by far, with 16,439 reports in the past fiscal year. Among the provinces, Karnali Province surprisingly reported the highest number of cybercrime complaints (333), followed by Bagmati Province (excluding cases handled by the Cyber Bureau) with 384, and Koshi Province with 1,149. Madhesh and Lumbini Provinces reported 683 and 500 cases, respectively, while Gandaki Province reported 182. Sudurpashchim Province reported the fewest, with just 60 cases. These figures may not directly reflect actual crime rates but rather highlight the uneven distribution of reporting mechanisms, public awareness, and trust in law enforcement. Low numbers in some provinces may stem from underreporting due to social stigma or lack of digital knowledge, while higher figures may suggest greater awareness and access to reporting systems.

    Facebook dominates Nepal’s cybercrime landscape, accounting for **over 81% of reported cases**. Its widespread use also makes it the most abused platform. Instagram, WhatsApp, and TikTok follow, while **Telegram is emerging as a rising concern**.  


    This trend underscores the urgent need for **platform accountability, localized guidelines, and faster moderation mechanisms**.


    - - -


    ## Legal Framework and Capacity Challenges


    Nepal still relies on the **Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) of 2006** as its primary cybercrime law. However, it is outdated and does not address:  


    * Deepfakes  

    * Cryptocurrency scams  

    * AI-generated impersonation  


    Meanwhile, the **Cyber Bureau** remains **under-resourced**:  


    * **106 personnel in total**  

    * Only **28 trained IT professionals**  


    This shortage hampers the ability to investigate and respond effectively, especially as cybercrime spreads beyond Kathmandu into rural areas.


    - - -


    ## Recommendations Moving Forward


    To counter the growing cyber threat, Nepal must:


    1. **Update legislation**: Draft a dedicated cybercrime law to replace the outdated ETA.  

    2. **Strengthen law enforcement**: Train more digital forensic experts across provinces.  

    3. **Expand digital literacy**: Integrate online safety and rights into school and college curricula.  

    4. **Support victims**: Provide psychological first aid, legal help, and safe reporting mechanisms.  

    5. **Improve accessibility**: Create a centralized, multilingual online complaint portal.

    ## Conclusion


    Cybercrime in Nepal is growing rapidly and visibly. As more people come online, risks grow too. But this also presents an **opportunity to educate, reform, and protect**.  


    By modernizing laws, expanding forensic capacity, boosting digital literacy, and supporting victims, Nepal can build not just a **more connected society** but also a **safer and more inclusive digital future**.

## Who Are the Victims?

Certain groups are disproportionately targeted:  

While cybercrime affects a broad cross-section of society, some groups are more vulnerable than others. Women make up 44.32% of all victims, often targeted through blackmail, harassment, revenge porn, and online impersonation. The digital space, which should be a place of expression and connection, is increasingly being weaponized against them. Children, too, are not spared; 3.2% of victims are minors who face threats, abuse, or exploitation before they are even equipped to understand digital risks. LGBTQI+ individuals account for 3.8% of reported cases, indicating the persistence of discrimination and targeted online hate even in virtual environments. These figures are not just statistics; they highlight how social inequalities are being replicated and amplified online, creating an unsafe environment for already marginalized communities.

> These numbers highlight how **offline inequalities are replicated and amplified online**, leaving vulnerable communities even more exposed.

[Open Data Nepal, Suicide and Cybercrime Data 2024](https://opendatanepal.com/dataset/suicide-and-cyber-crime-data-2024)

A closer look at the platforms involved reveals where the harm is happening. Facebook is by far the most reported platform, accounting for approximately 16,096 complaints, more than 81% of total cybercrime cases in 2023–24. Its dominance in Nepal’s social media landscape has also made it the prime space for abuse and digital exploitation. Instagram follows with around 1,114 cases, then WhatsApp with 981, TikTok with 721, and Telegram, while not quantified, has emerged as a rising concern. The pattern shows that platforms with higher user penetration bear the brunt of cyber-related grievances, but it also points to a pressing need for platform accountability, community guidelines tailored to local contexts, and faster content moderation mechanisms.

## Legal Framework and Capacity Challenges

Despite the growing threat, Nepal continues to rely on an outdated legal infrastructure to tackle cybercrime. The Electronic Transactions Act (ETA) of 2006 remains the foundational legal document, a law conceived in a very different digital era. This legislation fails to address modern-day threats such as deepfakes, cryptocurrency scams, and AI-generated impersonation. As technologies evolve and criminals get more sophisticated, Nepal’s law enforcement and regulatory frameworks are struggling to keep up. The Cyber Bureau, despite being the central institution for handling cybercrime, is under-resourced and understaffed. 
[Out of 106 personnel, only 28 are trained IT professionals](https://kathmandupost.com/national/2024/08/21/cybercrime-cases-spike-in-nepal), a striking shortfall considering the technical complexity of the crimes being investigated. This gap in digital forensic capacity hampers timely and effective responses, particularly as cybercrime spreads beyond Kathmandu into more rural provinces. 

---

## Recommendations Moving Forward

To counter the growing cyber threat, Nepal must urgently update its legislative frameworks to reflect the current digital ecosystem. This includes drafting and implementing a dedicated cybercrime law that goes beyond the outdated ETA and directly addresses new forms of online abuse, fraud, and manipulation. Strengthening provincial law enforcement by training more digital forensic experts will ensure that people across the country, not just in urban centers, can access justice. Education is also critical. Digital literacy, including basic online safety and rights, should be integrated into school and college curricula to equip young users with tools to protect themselves. Furthermore, the government should establish a formal support system for cybercrime victims, including psychological first aid, legal assistance, and safe reporting mechanisms. A centralized, multilingual online portal for filing complaints could improve accessibility and trust, especially for those in remote or underserved communities.

Cybercrime in Nepal is growing rapidly and visibly. As more people come online, the risks grow too. But this also presents an opportunity to educate, to reform, and to protect.

By updating legal frameworks, strengthening forensic and enforcement capacity, expanding digital literacy, and ensuring strong support systems for victims, Nepal can build not just a more connected society, but a safer and more inclusive digital future for all

## Conclusion

Cybercrime in Nepal is **growing rapidly**. But this challenge also brings an opportunity:  

By **updating laws, strengthening institutions, educating citizens, and protecting victims**, Nepal can build a safer and more inclusive digital future.
